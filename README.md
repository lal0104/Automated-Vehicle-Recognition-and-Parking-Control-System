## ðŸ““ Overview

| Machine Learning Models Applied            | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Random Forest | 81.10% |
| Logistic Regression | 80.61% |
| Support Vector Machine | 81.73% |
| XGB_Classifier | 80.52% |
| Gradient Boasting | 82.37% |

## ðŸ‘‰ Application

The ability to predict churn before it happens allows businesses to take proactive actions to keep existing customers from churning. This could look like: 
```
  Customer success teams reaching out to those high-risk customers to provide support or to gauge 
  what needs may not be being met.
```

The advantage of calculating a company's churn rate is that it provides clarity on how well the business is retaining customers, which is a reflection on the quality of the service the business is providing, as well as its usefulness.

## ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion

Conducted in-depth statistical analysis using EDA to identify churn drivers from a dataset of 7,043 customers, focusing on key business metrics like tenure and monthly charges.<br>
Engineered a Gradient Boosting model, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting customer churn and generating actionable insights that improved customer retention.
