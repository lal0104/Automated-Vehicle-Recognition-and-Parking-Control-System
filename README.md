## ðŸ‘‰ Challenges:<br>

Data Management Issues<br>
Manual Vehicle Monitoring<br>
Unauthorized Access<br>
Inexperienced Personnel
<br>


## ðŸ““ How It Works - Key Techniques Used

1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   Enhancing image quality by adjusting brightness, contrast, and noise reduction for better analysis.  

2. **Number Plate Detection:** 
   Identifying and extracting the vehicleâ€™s number plate region from the image.  

3. **Number Plate Recognition:**  Converting the detected number plate characters into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  

4. **Smart Diversion:**
   Automating traffic control by analyzing recognized plates to grant or restrict access based on predefined rules.

## ðŸ‘‰ Application

Automatically recognizes authorized vehicles, ensuring only the right ones get in while keeping intruders out.
```
 Technology makes what was once impossible, possible. The design makes it real.
```

 No more struggling to find a spotâ€”this system detects your vehicle and guides you to an available space.

## ðŸ”— Dataset:

The data used to train and test the ANPR system includes images of vehicle number plates, 
which are sourced from publicly available datasets, such as: 
Random Data Generation: A Python function was created to generate random vehicle number 
plates in the format CG [District Code] [2 Letters] [4 Digits], along with random designations 
like "STAFF" or "STUDENT". 
License Plate Recognition Datasets: Other publicly available datasets containing a variety of 
vehicle plates from different countries and regions. 
The system is also capable of integrating new plates into the database for further searches.
