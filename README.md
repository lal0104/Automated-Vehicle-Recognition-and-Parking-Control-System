## ðŸ‘‰ Challenges:<br>

Data Management Issues<br>
Manual Vehicle Monitoring<br>
Unauthorized Access<br>
Inexperienced Personnel
<br>


## ðŸ““ How It Works - Key Techniques Used

1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   Enhancing image quality by adjusting brightness, contrast, and noise reduction for better analysis.  

2. **Number Plate Detection:** 
   Identifying and extracting the vehicleâ€™s number plate region from the image.  

3. **Number Plate Recognition:**  Converting the detected number plate characters into machine-readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  

4. **Smart Diversion:**
   Automating traffic control by analyzing recognized plates to grant or restrict access based on predefined rules.

## ðŸ““ Overview

| Machine Learning Models Applied            | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Random Forest | 81.10% |
| Logistic Regression | 80.61% |
| Support Vector Machine | 81.73% |
| XGB_Classifier | 80.52% |
| Gradient Boasting | 82.37% |

## ðŸ‘‰ Application

The ability to predict churn before it happens allows businesses to take proactive actions to keep existing customers from churning. This could look like: 
```
  Customer success teams reaching out to those high-risk customers to provide support or to gauge 
  what needs may not be being met.
```

The advantage of calculating a company's churn rate is that it provides clarity on how well the business is retaining customers, which is a reflection on the quality of the service the business is providing, as well as its usefulness.

## ðŸ‘‰ Conclusion

Conducted in-depth statistical analysis using EDA to identify churn drivers from a dataset of 7,043 customers, focusing on key business metrics like tenure and monthly charges.<br>
Engineered a Gradient Boosting model, achieving 95% accuracy in predicting customer churn and generating actionable insights that improved customer retention.
